# haystack-ui

#### Pre-requisites

Ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed.

#### Build and Run

This application uses [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as the UI module bundler. To build + bundle all the required UI assets (CSS/JS) and run expressjs server, use:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start:dev
```

Once start is successful you can visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

To continuously re-build the assets while you are developing, use this command in a separate terminal:

```
$ npm run watch
```
